### Data source

We were provided with a dataset that contains the searches made in a parking lot application 

It contains information about the coordinates of the user's destination, the arrival and leaving time, and the day the search was made.

### Data Analysis




### Building the app

In order to let anyone use this application, we decided to deploy it on Heroku, a cloud Platform As a Service that allows us to develop, run, and manage the application without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.


### Visualisation 

To visualize the app we used Streamlit, a framework that allows us to turn the data scripts into a shareable web app.
